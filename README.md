Overview of the Project
Project: SmartHome Automation
Objective
To design and implement a smart home automation system that utilizes various sensors and actuators to monitor and control the environment within a home.

Key Activities
Temperature Monitoring
Uses an LM35 sensor to continuously measure and monitor ambient temperature.

Distance Measurement
Utilizes an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to an object.

Soil Moisture Detection
Employs a soil moisture sensor to measure soil moisture levels.

Motion Detection
Uses a PIR sensor to detect motion within its range.

Servo Motor Control
Controls a servo motor to adjust its position based on sensor inputs.

Software Used
Tinkercad: Used for simulation and prototyping of the smart home automation system.
